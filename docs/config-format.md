# The Harmony config format

Living specification. This is the deliverable other tools consume, so it is kept separate
from the narrative in [findings.md](findings.md). Anything stated here is confirmed against at
least two independent samples unless marked otherwise.

Work is focused on architectures 12 (Harmony One) and 14 (Harmony 600, 700), because those are
the remotes on the bench. Architectures 8 and 9 appear here as controls: they are what shows
whether a claim is about the format or only about those two models.

**It is one container across architectures, not one per architecture.** Each architecture has
its own four letter cookie, and the header shape behind it is the same. The 525's
`0xFEED`/`0xBEEF` framing appears inside this one, but at **section slot 0 only**, not once
per section. See [findings.md](findings.md) for the correction that replaced.

```
container header               absolute pointer table
  section 0   FEED ... BEEF    exactly one frame per container, always slot 0
  section 1                    seven bytes, states the architecture
  ...                          remaining sections, unframed, mostly unlabelled
u16 checksum + end marker
```

## Outer container

Validated against **fifteen samples across four architectures**, four base addresses
(`0x002000`, `0x020000`, `0x030000`, `0x040000`), three format versions and three pointer table
lengths (20, 21, 22). Every consistency check passes on all fifteen. See `tests/test_gspm.py`.

**Corrected here.** This paragraph said thirteen samples, five base addresses and four pointer
table lengths. The count was stale, and the other two numbers never matched the list beside them:
four addresses are named and the lengths are 20, 21 and 22. The counts are computed in
`tests/test_gspm.py` now rather than written down, so they cannot drift again.

```
0x00  char[4]  cookie          per architecture, see the table below
0x04  u32      end_addr        absolute flash address of the trailing end marker
0x08  u32      format          nibble BCD version: 0x1400 = 1.4, 0x1500, 0x1600
0x0B  item[N]  section_table   { u8 spare; u24 address }[N], see below
      char[4]  marker          per architecture; starts the key table on arch 8, 12 and 14
      u8       count
               { u8 event_code; u16 index; u8 flags }[count]
      ...      remaining sections, reached via section_ptr
end-6 u16      checksum        seeded word XOR, below
end-4 char[4]  end marker      per architecture
```

All little endian. Pointers are **absolute flash addresses, not offsets**, so a blob is
position dependent and cannot simply be relocated.

### The per architecture cookies

| Arch | Models | cookie | end marker | marker after the table | format seen |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 8 | 720, 785, 88x | `TPTP` | `DKDK` | `WLWL`, key table | `0x1500` |
| 9 | 36x, 51x, 52x, 55x | `AHCM` | `MCHA` | `CMAH`, contents unestablished | `0x1400` |
| 12 | One | `GSPM` | `PTYY` | `LWJL`, key table | `0x1600` |
| 14 | 600, 700 | `GSPM` | `PTYY` | `LWJL`, key table | `0x1400` |

The cookies agree with concordance's own per architecture table, which also lists `BMBM` for
arch 7 (the older 6xx). No arch 7 sample has been seen here, so its end marker is unknown and
it is deliberately absent from the parser. Architectures 2 and 3 use a two byte cookie and are
a different layout.

Note that `format` is not an architecture identifier: arch 9 and arch 14 both carry `0x1400`.
It is a generation of the format, and the cookie is what says which architecture.

### Recovering the base address

Needed to turn the pointers into file offsets, and derivable from the blob itself:

```
base = end_addr - (offset_of_end_marker - offset_of_cookie)
```

Exact on all fifteen samples. Worth noting against concordance's table, which lists arch 9's
`config_base` as `0x820000` where the derived value is `0x020000`; bit 23 looks like a flag
rather than an address bit. Deriving from the data sidesteps the question.

### The section table starts at `0x0B`, and an item is a spare byte plus a three byte pointer

```
0x0B  { u8 spare; u24 address }[N]
```

So the addresses land on `0x0C`, `0x10`, `0x14` and so on. The `spare` byte is **zero in every
section of every sample**, and its meaning is unestablished; it is not known to be padding. A
parser must not read the item as a `u32` pointer, because a nonzero `spare` would then add
`0x1000000` to the following address and produce a plausible wrong answer rather than an error.

| Architecture | N | table ends, marker at |
|---|---|---|
| 8 | 21 | `0x5F` |
| 9 | 20 | `0x5B` |
| 12 | 22 | `0x63` |
| 14 | 20 | `0x5B` |

Derive it rather than hardcoding per model:

```
N = (marker_offset - 0x0B) / 4
```

The marker itself is found from the data: it is the first four uppercase letters preceded by
three zero bytes. Those three bytes are the final section's NULL address, not padding, so the
heuristic works for a reason rather than by luck, and it would fail on a container whose last
section is populated. Which four letters they are is a per architecture fact, so the parser
asserts it against the table above rather than computing it.

**Corrected here.** This document previously put the table at `0x0C` with `N` one lower, treated
the three bytes before the marker as padding, and recorded an ambiguity: whether arch 8 and
arch 9 carried a trailing NULL slot or simply more padding. Both readings were wrong in the same
way. Once the table starts at `0x0B` the length follows from the marker position with no
remainder, so there is nothing left for padding to be ambiguous about. The evidence is arithmetic
on the whole corpus: `0x0B + 4 * N` equals the measured marker offset in all fifteen samples
across four architectures, where the old reading could only close by subtracting three bytes it
could not account for. Every address the old parser reported was still correct, because the slot
it lacked is NULL everywhere. See `docs/findings.md` section 20.

## The EZHex wrapper

A config as read off a remote or handed to it is an XML header, a `\r\n`, then the container as
raw bytes. The header makes the split verifiable, and pins what remote will accept the file.

```
<BINARYDATASIZE>   exact payload length in bytes; the payload is the last N bytes of the file
<CHECKSUM>         XOR of every payload byte, seeded 0x69
<INTENDEDVERSION>  PROTOCOL, SKIN, FLASH, BOARD that the remote must report
```

The size and checksum rules are verified on all eight config samples in the corpus,
`src/harmony/ezfile.py`. The consequence of `INTENDEDVERSION` is **reported, not verified
here**: harmony-decompiler states that a remote refuses a mismatched config with "This
configuration file is not compatible with your Harmony Remote". Nothing has been written to a
remote in this project, so treat that as the reason to match the header, not as our own
observation.

Not to be confused with the trailer checksum inside the container, which is a different
algorithm. This one covers the whole payload; that one is what the remote validates internally,
and it is derived below.

### The trailer checksum

**Confirmed on fourteen containers across four architectures**, sizes from 7115 bytes to 1672832,
and derived from the boot validator rather than guessed. A sixteen bit XOR of the container's
little endian words, seeded `0x4321`, from its first byte up to the stored value:

```python
accumulator = 0x4321
for offset in range(0, len(blob) - 6 - 1, 2):
    accumulator ^= int.from_bytes(blob[offset:offset + 2], 'little')
```

An odd trailing byte is not folded in, because the firmware divides the byte count by two and
counts words. No container in the corpus has an odd body.

**This is the value a writer has to get right**; the remote refuses a config whose checksum does
not recompute. It is also a weak check: a word XOR catches any single changed byte but is blind to
two transposed words and to any even number of identical changes, so a passing checksum means the
remote will not refuse the file, not that the file is correct.

Read with `gspm.trailer_checksum` or `trailerChecksum`, and the parse reports
`trailer_checksum_recomputes` as a container check. [findings.md](findings.md) section 41.

## Sections

**Every one of the twenty base slots is now accounted for.** Slots 0 and 1 are the header records,
slots 2 to 17 are sixteen named sections, and 18 and 19 are NULL in every sample.

The method that named them is described in
[roadmap.md](roadmap.md) step 6: the firmware copies each config pointer into a per-subsystem RAM
variable, so finding the consumer of that variable labels the section by function. The infrared
section was identified exactly this way, and every slot from 2 to 19 now has a located consumer.

A prior worth having, from the person who designed the format, in harmony-decompiler discussion
number 1: the table "is probably pointing to data for each of the various subsystems (IR
sending, state variables, menus, action lists etc)". That is a hint about what to expect, not
evidence about which slot is which.

**Slot numbers below are base layout slots.** The pointer table is one table across
architectures with per architecture insertions, so a slot number only means something once it is
said which layout it belongs to. See "One table, four architectures" further down; arch 9 and
arch 14 use the base layout directly.

Known so far:

| Slot | Meaning | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | the one `0xFEED` frame, holding a named tree rooted at `Root` | fifteen samples, below |
| 1 | seven byte record stating the architecture | fifteen samples, below |
| 5, 7, 10, 11, 12, 15 | count prefixed arrays of three byte flash pointers | nine configs, below |
| 5 | of those, the **infrared database**, grouped | ten configs, four architectures, below |
| 10 | of those, the **action list address table** | nine configs, below |
| 4 | the **firmware event map**: thirty events, each named in the space `0x7E` indexes | ten configs, four architectures, below |
| 3 | the build timestamp, and the firmware **starts Timer 1 from it**, so it is the clock | fifteen samples, three images, below |
| 6 | the **mode table**: what `0x7E` and the event map both index | ten configs, four architectures, below |
| 15 | the **parameter block**: numbered groups of 16 bit constants, every length demanded | thirteen containers, two images, below |
| 13 | the **state variable table**, named from its firmware consumer | ten configs, four architectures, below |
| 8 | **key press bindings**: records of `{ tag; operand; opcode }`, tag a press code | seven configs, four architectures, below |
| 7 | a pointer array **indexed by opcode 16 of the screen language** | three images, below |
| 9 | the **binding table**: eight to sixteen sets of button bindings with an enter and a leave handler | ten configs, four architectures, below |
| 11 | the **screen program table**: programs in the screen language | ten configs, four architectures, below |
| 14 | the **state value map**: what a state variable's value means, indexed by `0x72` | ten configs, four architectures, below |
| 16 | the **number sender**: how to transmit a value one decimal digit at a time | three images; empty in all twelve containers, below |
| 12 | the **timer table**: wait, then queue one instruction | ten configs, four architectures, below |
| 17 | the **touch screen hit map**, populated on arch 12 only | two configs, one image, below |
| 2 | the **log area**: a region of flash the firmware appends to and never erases | thirteen containers, one image, below |
| 18, 19 | NULL in every sample of every architecture | thirteen containers |

**Every slot from 2 to 19 has a located firmware consumer**, on the Harmony 700, the 600 and the
One. See [findings.md](findings.md) sections 35 and 38 for the addresses. On arch 12 the firmware
seeks every raw slot from 2 to 19 **except raw slot 8**, which is the NULL that architecture
inserts, and it does seek raw slot 18, which is the section it has and the base layout does not. So
the alignment rule below is how the firmware itself addresses the table.

**The distance from one pointer to the next is an upper bound on a section's size, not its size.**
Base slot 4 holds 125 bytes and the gap to slot 5 is between 419 and 1532 bytes, because slot 5's
infrared group arrays are laid out in that space. A section's own data can end long before the next
pointer, with another section's sub-structures filling the rest, so a large gap is not evidence of
a large section. See section 36.

### Base slot 2: the log area

**Confirmed on thirteen containers across four architectures**, and on the one arch 12 image, which
is the only firmware that reads it.

Not a pointer to a structure: three numbers reserving a region of flash above the config that the
firmware appends to and never erases.

```
+0x00  u16  capacity        u24 on arch 12, where the section is nine bytes
+0x02  u24  start           the first byte of the region
+0x05  u24  limit           one past its last byte
```

`limit - start == capacity * stride`, exactly, in every container, with one stride per
architecture: **8 bytes on arch 8, arch 9 and arch 14, and 1 on arch 12**. The region always sits
above the config's `end_addr`, and `limit` is always a round flash boundary: `0x080000`,
`0x100000`, `0x200000` or `0x400000`, except arch 8, which stops 8 KiB short of 2 MiB at
`0x1FE000`.

| container | arch | capacity | start | limit |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 700, 600 | 14 | 16384 | `0x1E0000` | `0x200000` |
| all three safe mode | 14 | 16384 | `0x0E0000` | `0x100000` |
| One, both | 12 | 16 | `0x3FFFF0` | `0x400000` |
| 525 | 9 | 8192 | `0x070000` | `0x080000` |
| all four 880s | 8 | 15360 | `0x1E0000` | `0x1FE000` |

The arch 12 firmware scans the region at boot, at `0x2DB4C`, for the last byte that is not `0xFF`,
and appends after it, so the write position is recovered from the erased pattern rather than
stored. The append routine at `0x2DC0A` writes one byte per call, refuses an address outside
`[0x040000, 0x400000)`, and refuses once `capacity` units are used up. Its only callers are five
branches of the same operand ladder that drives timers, operand high `0xE1` to `0xE5`, appending
one to six bytes each.

Read with `gspm.log_area`; `gspm.log_reference` names the append case an instruction selects.
[findings.md](findings.md) section 47.

*What is logged is not established*, nor is the stride of 8 on the three architectures whose
firmware never reads this section. **No config in the corpus appends to it**, so a writer that
copies these three numbers unchanged is doing everything the corpus does.

### Base slot 4: the firmware event map

**Confirmed on ten configs across four architectures**, and the same shape in every one.

```
+0x00  u24  fallback        used when no key matches
+0x03  u16  count           thirty, always
+0x05  { u8 key; u24 value }[count]
```

Keys are `0` to `29`, contiguous. Values are `N` to `N + 29`, contiguous, and the fallback is `N`.
Only `N` varies: 19 on the 700, 14 on the 600, 11 on the 525, 10 on both Ones, 4 on all four 880s.

The firmware raises an event by loading a literal key and looking it up here, and the value goes to
the same register opcode `0x7E`'s operand goes to. So the two share a numbering space, and the
block `N` to `N + 29` is **reserved**: across ten configs `0x7E` names 1246 distinct operands and
lands inside the block once, on the 525. On the programmed Harmony One the config uses 0 to 9, the
block takes 10 to 39, and the config resumes at 40, abutting on both sides.

Read with `gspm.event_map`.
*What the thirty events are, and what the numbering space counts, are not established.*
[findings.md](findings.md) section 36.

**This section is 125 bytes**, not the 419 to 1532 that the distance to the next pointer reports.
See the warning under "Sections" about what that distance means.

### Base slot 6: the mode table

**Confirmed on ten configs across four architectures.**

```
+0x00  u24  count
+0x03  u24  address[count]
```

A `u24` count, where the six recognised pointer arrays use a `u8` or a `u16`, so the parser's array
heuristic does not pick this slot up.

**The count is exactly one more than the largest `0x7E` operand, in every config**, over counts from
103 to 374. Every value in the event map of base slot 4 is in range too. So `0x7E` and the event map
both index this table, and `0x7E` is the instruction that **switches to the entry its operand
names**.

**The pointer does not land on the entry.** It lands inside the record, on a discriminator byte
with a `u24` back pointer to the record's start immediately after it, exactly as base slot 5's
infrared records do:

```
at the record start   u8 count; { u8 tag; u16 operand; u8 opcode }[count]
at the table pointer  u8 kind; u24 the record's own start
```

Records are contiguous and run to about seven hundred bytes, so the pointer lands hundreds of bytes
past the head. Closures over 1616 records in eight containers: the back pointer always points
backwards, and the count read at the start always gives a list that fits inside the record, where a
wrong start overruns.

An entry maps a **tag** to one action list instruction. Two tags are the handlers: **tag 7 when the
mode is left and tag 6 when it is entered**, the only two either arch 14 image selects, and on both
Harmony Ones every mode carries exactly one of each. The rest are key codes.

**The container's key table is the first mode record**, byte for byte: same offset, same count,
same four byte entries. The tagged list encoding and the key table encoding are one encoding.

**A screen program follows the list**, at the record's start plus the list's length, and every
record has one on arch 8, 12 and 14: 374 of 374, 237 of 237, 268 of 268, 103 of 103, and 35 of 35 in
a safe mode container. Arch 9 manages only 43 of 114, so there the record's tail is a different
thing and is not established. That program is where the region's large
pictures are addressed from. [findings.md](findings.md) section 53.

Read with `gspm.mode_records` and `gspm.mode_program_roots`; `gspm.mode_table` returns the raw
pointers. [findings.md](findings.md) section 52.

*It is not the activity list*: a Harmony has a handful of activities and this table has hundreds of
entries. What distinguishes one entry from another is not established.
[findings.md](findings.md) section 37.

### Tagged lists

Base slots 6 and 9 both point at lists in this encoding, and one firmware routine reads both. Which
of the two forms applies is decided by the first byte, exactly as the firmware decides it:

```
+0x00  u8   count                                     when nonzero
+0x01  { u8 tag; u16 operand; u8 opcode }[count]
```

```
+0x00  u8   0
+0x01  u8   count
+0x02  { u8 flags; u8 tag; u16 operand; u8 opcode }[count]
```

The firmware stops at the **first** entry whose tag matches and runs nothing else, so a duplicate
tag is unreachable through anything but its first copy. A writer that emits two entries with one tag
has emitted dead data, silently. Bit 0 of `flags` in the second form is tested after the match and
what it selects is *not established*.

Read with `gspm.tagged_list`. [findings.md](findings.md) section 39.

### Base slot 9: the binding table

**Confirmed on ten configs across four architectures.**

```
+0x00  u8   count
+0x01  u24  address[count]
```

Eight to sixteen entries, each pointing at a tagged list. **The largest index any config uses is
exactly the count minus one, in all ten**, over counts from 8 to 16.

The index is carried by opcode `0x1F` with the operand's high byte `0xFF` and the index in the low
byte. When it changes, the firmware runs the outgoing entry's list with **tag 2** and the incoming
one's with **tag 1**, the same leave and enter arrangement base slot 6 has with tags 7 and 6.

An entry's other tags are **key event codes**, by the same `EVENT_MASK` and `SCAN_MASK` split base
slot 8 uses: `0x81` is a press of scan code 1. So an entry is a set of button bindings with a
lifecycle.

The two Harmony 700 configs differ in exactly one place in this section, one added binding with a
press tag in one entry, and their owner's notes record exactly one added standard button assignment
in one activity.

*What an entry corresponds to is not established.* That owner describes a six device installation
and the table has eleven entries, so it is not the device list; devices and activities together is
the reading the counts support and it is not proven.

Read with `gspm.handler_sets` and `gspm.handler_index`. [findings.md](findings.md) section 39.

### Base slot 14: the state value map

**Confirmed on ten configs across four architectures.**

```
+0x00  u8   count
+0x01  u24  address[count]
```

and at each address

```
+0x00  u8   stepped over by the firmware; 2 in every record in the corpus
+0x01  count                 u16 on arch 14, u8 on arch 8, 9 and 12
+...   { u16 value; u24 address }[count]
+...   u8   count of the range table
+...   { u16 low; u16 high; u24 address }[count]
```

The **count width differs by architecture and the key width does not**. That is read off the
layout: compute a record's length under each of the four combinations of widths and ask whether it
lands on another record's start. One combination per architecture accounts for at least four fifths
of the records and the other three are all behind it.

Opcode `0x72` names both halves of this at once. Its operand's **low byte is a state variable
index** into base slot 13 and its **high byte selects the record** here. The record is searched for
the variable's value, then, if nothing matched, for a range containing it; the bounds are inclusive.
Both operand bounds hold in all ten configs and neither is ever overrun.

**The payload is a flash address, not an instruction.** All 9776 targets across ten configs land
inside their own container. The firmware follows one and hands it to a **second interpreter**, a
one byte opcode language with ten opcodes and a terminator, which is not the action list language
and is not decoded. Base slot 6's mode switch reaches the same interpreter.

Records share their tails: a few addresses point into the middle of a longer record rather than to
a record of their own, so two records can overlap by design.

The range table is empty in eight of the ten configs; two carry one range between them.

Read with `gspm.value_maps` and `gspm.value_map_reference`. [findings.md](findings.md) section 39.

### The screen language

A second interpreter, unrelated to the action lists, with its own one byte opcodes. It draws the
display. Programs are reached from base slot 11, from a base slot 14 lookup, and on arch 8 and arch
14 from a mode entry.

| opcode | operands | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | none | end |
| 1 | 4 bytes, `u16` | repeat a primitive |
| 2 | 2 position bytes, `u24` | draw the **bitmap** at that address, below |
| 3 | 6 bytes, `u24` | the same with a larger position record |
| 4 | 2 position bytes, `u24` | draw the glyph string at that address |
| 5 | 2 position bytes, then the string | draw the glyph string inline |
| 16 | 1 byte | index base slot 7 by it |
| 17 | `u16` operand, `u8` opcode | queue an action list instruction |
| 18, 19 | a switch, below | switch on a state variable and jump |
| 20 | `u24` | jump |
| 21 | 4 bytes | *arch 8 only*, meaning unknown, length inferred from the corpus |
| 22 | *not established* | in the arch 12 dispatcher, used by no config |
| 23 | none | *arch 12 only*, its handler reads nothing; one per mode program |

A switch:

```
u8    state variable index
count                                     u8 in opcode 18, u16 in opcode 19
{ value; u24 target }[count]              value likewise one byte or two
count
{ low; high; u24 target }[count]
```

**The inline strings are glyph indices, not characters.** The renderer resolves one by indexing a
font table by the code minus one, and not one string in the corpus decodes as printable ASCII. A
code with bit 7 set is the first half of a wide one and takes a second byte with it, so a
terminator cannot be found by scanning for a zero; no string in the corpus is wide.

**20260 programs across thirteen containers and four architectures decode with nothing left over**,
which is the check that matters: instructions are variable length with no length field, so a wrong
operand count desynchronises the walk immediately. Programs are reached from base slot 11, from a
base slot 14 lookup, and on arch 8 and arch 14 **from a mode record**, whose own program sits
immediately after its tagged list. That third source is 2008 of the total and is where the full
screen pictures are named. [findings.md](findings.md) section 53.

Read with `gspm.screen_program` and `gspm.screen_program_roots`, or dump one with
`tools/screen_dump.py`. [findings.md](findings.md) section 40.

#### What opcode 2 draws

The only screen instruction that names a place outside its own program. At the address:

```
+0x00  u8   kind
+0x01  u16  stride, in bytes per row
+0x03  u16  rows
+0x05       the pixels
```

`stride` is in **pixels** and a pixel is two bytes, so `kind` 0 is exactly `5 + 2 * stride * rows`
bytes. Pictures are laid out contiguously and consecutive ones sit exactly that far apart.
`kind` 1 discards the two sizes and uses the base slot 7 glyph encoding instead, skip and literal
over **two byte** pixels, ending at a `0x00` control byte; it breaks rows exactly `rows - 1` times
even though it threw the header away, which is the closure its extent rests on. `kind` 2 is a bare `RETURN` in the firmware, valid and drawing nothing, and a
higher value is not reached at all.

Two rails for a writer, both read off the firmware and invisible in the corpus:

* only the **low byte** of each `u16` is loaded, so a value above 255 is taken modulo 256, silently,
* the row loop stops drawing above **row 128** but still advances the stream.

Every opcode 2 address in the corpus decodes. Strides are per model, 12 on the 600 and the 700, 16
to 19 on arch 8, and 20, 22 or 88 on the One; row counts are 10, 11 or 18. Arch 9 and the safe mode
containers emit no opcode 2 and hold no bitmaps.

**Two size classes.** The ones a base slot 11 program names are icons, 245 to 1765 bytes. The ones a
**mode record's** program names are full screens: stride 128 over 128 rows on arch 14, 128 over 160
on arch 8, and **176 over 220 on arch 12**, which is the Harmony One's panel. Together they are
**98% of the region** on a Harmony 600, 93% on a 700, 97% on arch 8 and 48% on a Harmony One.

Opcode 3 draws the same object with a six byte position record instead of two. It is used by one
instruction in the whole corpus, so its operand layout is read from the firmware and exercised by
almost nothing.

#### What fills the region

Not the bitmaps above. The region is **raw image data**: rows of 176 **big endian RGB565** pixels
on arch 12, with a screen of 220 rows, so a full screen is 77440 bytes. Recovered on both Harmony
Ones by minimising the vertical pixel difference over candidate widths, and the height is fixed
independently by blank screens of exactly that length. There is **no header and no framing**, so
where one image starts is unknown, and **nothing found so far addresses them**. The width on arch
14 is not established. `harmony/region.py`, [findings.md](findings.md) section 51.

### Base slot 11: the screen program table

```
+0x00  u16  count
+0x02  u24  address[count]
```

One of the six recognised pointer arrays. Each entry is a screen program. On arch 14, 5703 of the
700's 5711 entries are the same two instruction program, queue one action list instruction and end,
so the table is mostly indirection.

### Base slot 7: the font table

A count prefixed pointer array of 5 to 18 entries, indexed by **opcode 16 of the screen language**.
Each entry is one typeface:

```
+0x00  u8   glyph height in pixels, shared by every glyph in the set
+0x01  u8   the glyph count on arch 12, and 1 on arch 8, 9 and 14
+0x02  u8   the glyph count on arch 8, 9 and 14, and 0 on arch 12
+0x03  u24  glyph[count]     NULL for a code this config never draws
```

and each glyph

```
+0x00  u8   width in pixels
```

followed by one byte operations: `0x00` ends the glyph, a byte with bit 7 set skips that many
background pixels, and a byte below `0x80` introduces that many literal pixels of **two bytes**
each. A row is exactly `width` pixels and the next begins as soon as that many are accounted for;
the height comes from the set header rather than from the glyph.

The count is the same for every set in a container and differs between containers, 46 to 76, so it
is a character set size chosen per config. Which of the two header bytes holds it is *measured, not
explained*: the firmware reads the pair as one `u16` and never bounds a code with it.

**A glyph code is one based**, because zero terminates an inline string, so the firmware indexes the
set by the code minus one.

Three checks, on twelve containers across three architectures:

* every row comes to exactly `width`, for **3933 glyphs**, with no stream ending mid row
* every glyph decodes to exactly the height its set declares, 3933 of 3933
* every inline string resolves: **40588 glyph codes** land on a non-NULL glyph of the font their
  own program selected, none out of range and none on an empty slot

Decoding with a one byte pixel instead fails on almost all of them, which is the calibration.
**Arch 9 uses a different packing** and `gspm.images` refuses it rather than guessing.

Read with `gspm.font_sets`, `gspm.Container.images` and `gspm.Container.glyph`; draw them with
`tools/screen_dump.py --images` or `--strings`. [findings.md](findings.md) section 46.

### Base slot 17: the touch screen hit map

**Confirmed on the two Harmony One configs and the Harmony One 3.4 image.** Empty, with a count of
zero, in the other eleven containers in the corpus: arch 8, arch 9, arch 14 and all three safe mode
ones. The Harmony One is the only remote here with a touch panel.

```
+0x00  u8   pages
+0x01  u24  page[pages]
```

each page

```
+0x00  u8   areas
+0x01  u24  area[areas]
```

each area, twelve bytes

```
+0x00  u16  x
+0x02  u16  width
+0x04  u16  y
+0x06  u16  height
+0x08  u8   the key code a hit reports
+0x09  u24  the record's own address
```

The firmware walks a page in order and **returns the first rectangle containing the point**, with
the test half open on both axes, `x <= X < x + width`. Rectangles on a page do overlap, 104 pairs
across the corpus, so a writer must treat a page's order as meaningful. The panel reports thirteen
bit coordinates and the largest rectangle reaches 4437.

A page's areas are laid out contiguously immediately before the page's own header, and each area's
last three bytes are its own address; both hold for every page and every area in both configs.

The code at `+0x08` takes ten values, 43, 44, 46, 47 and 48 to 53, which sit inside the block of
scan codes the One's key table carries where arch 14 numbers 41 to 54. A page's codes run 48
upward consecutively, then 43 and 44 for the two largest pages, and always end with 46 and 47,
which are a tall strip at each edge of the panel. Nine page shapes exist and no others.

**The geometry is not user data.** Two Harmony Ones with entirely different configurations carry
the same 35 rectangle sizes and share 70 of 70 distinct records; only the number of pages differs.

Read with `gspm.touch_pages` and `gspm.Container.touch_hit`. [findings.md](findings.md) section 45.

### Base slot 15: the parameter block

**Confirmed on thirteen containers across four architectures**, and every length claim below is a
literal in the firmware rather than a count of what the corpus carries.

```
+0x00  u8   count
+0x01  u24  address[count]
```

and at each address a group

```
+0x00  u8   entries
+0x01  u16  value[entries]
```

The groups are laid out in one run immediately before the pointer array. On arch 8, arch 9 and
arch 14 the run is exactly the sum of the groups; arch 12 has twelve spare bytes in it.

**The firmware demands the section's count and every group's length.** The count is 9 on arch 14
and 11 on arch 12. Each group is read only when its length matches the number that build expects,
and otherwise the subsystem silently uses constants compiled into the firmware:

| group | arch 14 | arch 12 |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 4 | 6 |
| 2 | 1 | |
| 3 | 4 | |
| 4 | | 6 |
| 5 | 14 | 16 |
| 6 | 14 | |
| 7 | 1 | 1 |
| 9 | | 6 |
| 10 | | 8 |

A blank is a group with no call site on the image that was read, not a length of zero. Arch 8 and
arch 9 are absent because no firmware for either exists here. `gspm.PARAMETER_GROUP_COUNTS` carries
this table and `gspm.parameter_group_lengths_match` checks a container against it.

**A group index is not portable between architectures.** Arch 9's five groups line up with a subset
of arch 12's in a different order, which is unlike every other indexed structure in this format.

Group 7 is a single value handed to the one second scheduler, with a firmware default of 10, and
every config carries 0. Groups 5 and 6 are two versions of a non decreasing curve walked against a
measurement to produce a level, and reading them as battery millivolts fits the cells those remotes
take but is *a conjecture, not established*. Group 4 is `96, 98, 308, 310, 768, 770` in all twelve
arch 8, 12 and 14 containers, and what it thresholds is *not established*. The rest are
*not established*.

Read with `gspm.parameter_groups`. [findings.md](findings.md) section 44.

### Base slot 12: the timer table

**Confirmed on ten configs across four architectures**, with three more as a negative case.

```
+0x00  u8   count
+0x01  u24  address[count]
```

and at each address a seven byte record

```
+0x00  u8   kind, 1 for the one second scheduler
+0x01  u24  duration, in seconds for kind 1
+0x04  u24  the single action list instruction queued when it expires
```

A timer is started by opcode `0x1F` with the operand's high byte `0xEB`, and cancelled by the same
opcode with `0xEA`; the operand's low byte is the index into this section in both. **The set of
indices started is exactly `0` to `count - 1` in every config**, counts from 5 to 30, and no
instruction names a record that is not there. The three safe mode containers carry no records and
issue neither instruction.

The firmware runs at most **four** timers at once, so a config with thirty records describes thirty
possible timers rather than thirty concurrent ones, and starting a fifth is a silent no-op.

**A timer fires exactly one instruction**, not a list. Anything longer has to be a single
instruction that runs an action list, which is what 116 of the corpus's 159 records do. The
scheduled kind also **clamps the duration to sixteen bits**, so a value above 65535 becomes 65535
rather than an error. Both are rails for a writer.

Kind `0` is counted down in software instead and no config in the corpus uses it, so its rate is
*not established*.

Read with `gspm.timers` and `gspm.timer_reference`. [findings.md](findings.md) section 43.

### Base slot 16: the number sender

**Read from three firmware images and unexercised by any container.** All twelve containers in the
corpus carry a count of zero here, so the layout below comes from the code alone and no sample
confirms it.

```
+0x00  u8   count
+0x01  u24  address[count]
```

and at each address

```
+0x00  u8   flags
+0x01  u24  base, added to the value before conversion
+0x04  u8   minimum number of digits
+0x05  u24  instruction queued first
+0x08  u24  instruction queued last
+0x0B  u24  instruction queued before the digits when the value is long enough
+0x0E  u24  first digit table
+0x11  u24  middle digit table
+0x14  u24  last digit table
```

Each digit table is ten three byte instructions indexed by the digit. The firmware adds `base` to
the value it is given, converts the sum to packed decimal by subtracting `10000`, `1000`, `100` and
`10` in four loops, and queues one instruction per digit, taking it from the first, middle or last
table according to where the digit sits. `flags` bit 2 makes the prefix instruction fire at a
hundred and bit 1 at ten; with neither, it never fires. Bit 0 makes the prefix consume a digit.

The fourteen bytes read in sequence end exactly where the first of the three fixed pointer offsets
begins, which is the closure for this layout, and the routine is identical on the 700, the 600 and
the One.

Read with `gspm.number_senders`. [findings.md](findings.md) section 39.

### Base slot 13: the state variable table

**Confirmed on ten configs across four architectures**, and named from the firmware routine that
loads it rather than from what the bytes look like.

```
+0x00  u16  count           how many variables
+0x02  u16  narrow          how many are stored as one byte
+0x04  u16  wide            how many are stored as two bytes; narrow + wide == count
+0x06  u16  narrow again    the same number a second time, purpose unestablished
+0x08  u24  entry[count]
```

`8 + 3 * count` equals the section's length exactly, in all ten. Counts run from 24 to 94.

The firmware copies this into RAM as two runs, `narrow` single bytes followed by `wide` pairs, so
**an index below `narrow` is a one byte variable and an index at or above it is a two byte one**.

The opcodes that index it are `0x70`, `0x71` and `0x72`, in the operand's low byte. Every index in
every config is below that config's own `count`, and the halves are respected exactly:

| opcode | uses | indices |
|---|---|---|
| `0x71` | 2164 | always below `narrow`, matching a handler that compares a byte |
| `0x70` | 146 | always at or above `narrow`, matching a handler that compares the sixteen bit accumulator |
| `0x72` | 501 | either half |

Read with `gspm.state_table` and `gspm.state_index`.
*What an individual variable means, and what the `count` pointers reach, are not established.*
[findings.md](findings.md) section 35.

### Base slot 5: the infrared database

**Confirmed on ten configs across four architectures.** Two levels of pointer array over records of
mark and space durations.

```
base slot 5:  u8  count
              u24 group_address[count]

per group:    u8  zero            the same spare byte the section table carries
              u16 count
              u24 record_address[count]

per record:   u8  kind            14 byte header, four pointers, the first always this
              u24 pointer           record's own address minus seven; purpose unknown
              u8  kind
              u24 pointer
              u24 pointer
              u24 pointer
              u16 duration[]      bit 15 set is a mark, bits 14..0 are microseconds
```

49 groups and 3058 record pointers checked: the lead byte is zero every time, each group is exactly
`3 + 3 * count` bytes and groups are packed adjacently, every record pointer is inside the
container, and none of them is an action list address.

**The number of groups equals the number of distinct high bytes a `0x7C` operand takes**, in all
ten configs, with the group indices contiguous from zero. The count runs from 1 to 7, and the
unprogrammed Harmony One is the minimal case at 1.

The duration run has bit 15 strictly alternating, and is framed as `header mark, header space,
bits * (mark, space), trailing mark, trailing gap`. So the run from the first mark is
`2 * bits + 4` values, which holds for all 2137 framed records in the corpus.

| header mark / space | records | bits, from the run length |
|---|---|---|
| 8990 / 4490, 9000 / 4500 | 1052 | 32, every one |
| 3480 / 1730, 3460 / 1730, 3364 / 1682 | 313 | 48, every one |
| 4500 / 4500, 4485 / 4485 | 168 | 32 |
| 4000 / 4500 | 111 | 24 |

Those header timings name NEC and Kaseikyo, whose bit counts are 32 and 48. Two quantities computed
from opposite ends of the record, agreeing with no exception.

**Not every record uses this encoding.** The whole arch 9 sample uses something else, and the 880
has a second population with headers near 303 / 310. The firmware routes four infrared encoding
classes; this is one.

Read with `gspm.ir_groups`, `gspm.ir_pulses` and `gspm.ir_frame`. The reader locates the duration
run rather than assuming a fixed offset, because some records carry a prefix of `0x7FFF` words
whose length varies.

*What a group is, and what the 14 byte header holds, are not established.*
[findings.md](findings.md) section 32.

### Base slot 8: key press bindings

*This was an unconfirmed candidate, described as "per assignment records, possibly bytecode" on the
strength of being the only section whose size changed in the controlled pair. It is read now.*

```
+0x00  u8 count; { u16 operand; u8 opcode }[count]      one ordinary action list
       then repeated to the end of the section:
         u8 count; { u8 tag; u16 operand; u8 opcode }[count]
         0x00 bytes between records are skipped
```

An entry is an action list instruction with a tag byte in front. The walk consumes the section
exactly, on seven configs across architectures 8, 9, 12 and 14, and a walk that starts one byte out
desynchronises immediately, which is what makes consuming it the validation.

**The tag is a key press.** Under the same `EVENT_MASK` and `SCAN_MASK` split as the key table,
every tag in every sample is a press, `0x80`, and the scan codes are model specific: 2, 8, 9 and 34
on architecture 14; 43, 44 and 48 to 53 on architecture 12; 30, 31, 38 and 39 on architecture 9;
5 to 8, 44 to 46 and 48 on architecture 8.

**The controlled pair closes it.** The owner's account of the one change includes two new additional
buttons. Slot 8 grew by 8 bytes, an entry is 4, the record count is unchanged, and exactly one
record went from two entries to four. [findings.md](findings.md) section 27.

Slot 8's `0x7F` instructions also call **every** action list in the final packed run, exactly once
each, which is the only thing that reaches those lists.

Still established negatively, and still worth stating: **the key table is not the button to action
map.** It is byte identical across that pair while the described change reassigned buttons. Slot 8
is where a press meets an action list; the key table is something else.

### Slot 0: the only `0xFEED` frame

Exactly one frame per container, always at slot 0. Confirmed on fifteen samples across four
architectures, and confirmed as *exclusive* by validating every `0xFEED` byte pair in each
container: no other one closes.

```
+0x00  u16      0xFEED        stored little endian, so `ed fe` in a hex dump
+0x02  u16      length        counted from the cookie, stops short of the terminator
+0x04  u8       00            zero in every sample
+0x05  ...      payload       begins A7 08 00 00 00 00 00 "Root"
+len   u16      0xBEEF
```

The frame therefore occupies `length + 2` bytes, and in all fifteen samples the slot 1 pointer
lands on exactly that byte. That is an independent confirmation of the length rule, because the
pointer and the length come from different places in the file.

One exception, and it is the reason `length` is validated rather than trusted: the Harmony
One's safe mode config carries a **degenerate empty frame**, `ed fe 00 00 00 ef be`, whose
length is 0 while its terminator sits five bytes in. Read `length == 0` as "empty" rather than
as an offset. Whether the firmware's own parser special cases it that way is **unconfirmed**;
no arch 12 or arch 14 config parser has been located in the firmware yet.

The payload is a tree of named nodes. In the Harmony 700 sample it holds 62 names, of the shape
`TV_Power_2`, `Receiver_Input_16`, `PowerOnDelay_<deviceid>_65278`, and the trailing number
looks like the variable's range rather than its value. That reading is a **lead, not a
finding**: the firmware routine that consumes the section has not been found, so what the
section is *for* is still open. `.claude/skills/trace-section/SKILL.md` is the method that
would settle it.

### Slot 1: the config states its own architecture

A fixed seven byte record:

```
+0x00  u8       architecture   the protocol number: 8, 9, 12, 14
+0x01  u8       architecture   the same value again
+0x02  u16      version word   per model, meaning not established
+0x04  u8[3]    00 00 00
```

Confirmed on fifteen samples spanning architectures 8, 9, 12 and 14. Every one has its
architecture established independently of this record, from the EZHex header's `<PROTOCOL>`
field on nine of them and from the firmware package the container was extracted from on the
other three, so each sample is a calibration case rather than a self-consistency check.

This is the field that makes a config self describing, which the application needs: a config
read off a remote over USB arrives with no EZHex header, and the cookie is not enough because
`GSPM` covers both arch 12 and arch 14.

The `version word` is **unconfirmed as to meaning**. What is measured:

| Sample | arch | word |
|---|---|---|
| One safe mode config, from firmware 3.4 | 12 | 3126 |
| arch 8 configs, all four | 8 | 3343 |
| Harmony 525 config | 9 | 3350 |
| Harmony One user configs, two different units | 12 | 3387 |
| Harmony 700 user config, and the container inside 700 firmware 2.8 | 14 | 3394 |
| Harmony 600 user config | 14 | 3401 |

So it is not the architecture (arch 14 shows two values), not the config contents (four arch 8
configs that differ in 73 to 84 percent of their bytes share it), and not purely the model (the
One's safe mode config differs from the One's user config). A generator or target firmware
version is the obvious guess and remains a guess.

Observed pointer values, for orientation:

| Slot | One safe cfg @`0x2000` | One user cfg @`0x40000` | 600 user cfg @`0x30000` | 700 user cfg @`0x30000` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | `0x0029AD` | `0x076197` | `0x063702` | `0x06E3B5` |
| 1 to 6 | `0x0029B4`..`0x002A50` | `0x0762AE`..`0x076740` | `0x063D26`..`0x064007` | `0x06ECCD`..`0x06F1A6` |
| 7 | `0x004107` | `0x085E44` | `0x072CDB` | `0x0812C1` |
| 8 | NULL | NULL | `0x072D0A` | `0x0812F6` |
| 9 to 18 | `0x00410C`..`0x0042BA` | `0x085E7C`..`0x08C076` | `0x0734B5`..`0x07A33B` | `0x0820FE`..NULL |
| 19 | `0x0042BC` | `0x08C078` | NULL | NULL |
| 20, 21 | NULL, NULL | NULL, NULL | n/a, 20 slots only | n/a, 20 slots only |

The non-NULL pointers ascend with the slot number in every sample, so sections are laid out in
slot order. That is what makes a section length well defined, since the header does not state
one: a section runs to the next non-NULL pointer, and the last runs to the trailer.

The NULL slots are per architecture rather than per config, in every sample of each: slots 18 and
19 on arch 9 and arch 14, slots 8, 19 and 20 on arch 8, slots 8, 20 and 21 on arch 12. In base
slot terms that is one statement rather than three, since **base slots 18 and 19 are NULL on all
four architectures** and the rest is where each architecture's insertions put them.

### Slot 3: when the config was built

An eleven byte framed record:

```
+0x00  u16      0xADDF         cookie
+0x02  u8       second         0 to 59
+0x03  u8       minute
+0x04  u8       hour           24 hour
+0x05  u8       day of month   1 to 31
+0x06  u8       day of week    0 = Saturday, 1 = Sunday, ... 6 = Friday
+0x07  u8       month          0 = January
+0x08  u8       year           offset from 2000
+0x09  u16      0xEFBF         terminator
```

Confirmed on fifteen samples across all four architectures, and the field assignment is a search
result rather than a reading: of the 24 permutations of the four date bytes, times two month
bases, times seven weekday offsets, **exactly one is consistent with every sample**. See
`docs/findings.md` section 21.

The day of week is not an independent field. It equals **days since 1 January 2000, modulo 7**,
which is why 0 means Saturday: that date was one. So the weekday encoding and the year offset
agree on a single epoch, and that agreement is the numeric closure behind this whole reading. A
record whose weekday disagrees with its date is refused rather than reported, in both parsers.

The cookie pair is **unique in every blob**, unlike slot 0's `0xFEED`, which occurs about once
per 64 KiB by chance. So this record can be located without a length field.

What the firmware does with it is **not established**, so this is not a section label. What is
established is what the bytes are.

Two things worth having for free:

* Every config in the corpus can now be dated, which is provenance nobody has to record by hand.
  The two Harmony One factory configs, one dumped off a remote and one extracted from firmware
  3.4, agree to the second at 2007-10-24 02:22:08, and the factory config inside Harmony 700
  firmware 2.8 reads 2009-04-15, both matching when those models shipped.
* The application gets a "built on" field for a config it reads over USB, where there is no EZHex
  header to take one from.

### Six sections are arrays of three byte pointers

Recognised structurally rather than tabulated. A section is such an array when a `u8` or `u16`
count at its start satisfies `width + 3 * count == section_length` exactly:

```
+0x00  u8 or u16   count
       u24[count]  absolute flash addresses, little endian, ascending
```

Three bytes, not four, because 24 bits covers the config region with room to spare and the
arrays are large: slot 10 of the Harmony 700 config holds 8037 entries, where a fourth byte
would cost 8 KiB in that one section.

That test picks out **the same six base slots in all nine config samples** across four
architectures, and rejects every other section. Every entry lands inside the container, and
every array ascends.

The confirmation that these are pointers rather than a shape that happens to fit is the Harmony
700 pair: two configs of one remote where the whole layout shifted by 50 bytes and then 58. In
five of the six arrays every single entry moved by exactly that shift, and the shift is known
independently, from the container's own pointer table. Slot 10 is the exception, and it is an
informative one: its entries moved by fourteen different deltas, because it addresses the region
that was rewritten rather than merely displaced.

| Base slot | count width | entries, 700 | 600 | 525 | One | arch 8 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 5 | `u8` | 6 | 4 | 4 | 5 | 3 |
| 7 | `u16` | 17 | 15 | 5 | 18 | 14 |
| 10 | `u16` | 8037 | 4955 | 487 | 4277 | 1318 |
| 11 | `u16` | 5711 | 3810 | 22 | 59 | 28 |
| 12 | `u8` | 9 | 5 | 5 | 30 | 19 |
| 15 | `u8` | 9 | 9 | 5 | 11 | 9 |

What most of them point at is **not yet established**. The counts are suggestive (slot 10's
thousands of entries against slot 5's handful) but a count is not a label. Two things are known:

* **Base slots 5, 7 and 15 index the section immediately before them.** Every entry of base slot 5
  lands inside base slot 4, every entry of base slot 7 inside base slot 6, every entry of base slot
  15 inside base slot 14. All entries, all five configs measured, four architectures. Base slots
  10, 11 and 12 point elsewhere, mostly into the large region ahead of slot 0.
* **Base slot 10 is the action list address table**, below.

### Base slot 10: action lists

Each entry addresses an action list, and a list is:

```
+0x00  u8    count
       { u16 operand; u8 opcode }[count]
```

So a list occupies `1 + 3 * count` bytes, and the lists are packed back to back: in every config
measured, all but exactly **four** consecutive table entries sit exactly `1 + 3 * count` apart.

| Sample | lists | instructions | packed pairs |
|---|---|---|---|
| 700 user config, arch 14 | 8037 | 19651 | 8032 of 8036 |
| 600 user config, arch 14 | 4955 | 12194 | 4950 of 4954 |
| One user config, arch 12 | 4277 | 11640 | 4272 of 4276 |
| 88x class config, arch 8 | 1318 | 3311 | 1313 of 1317 |
| 525 config, arch 9 | 487 | 1043 | 482 of 486 |

The four exceptions per config are not noise. The lists are packed into exactly **five contiguous
runs**, so there are four places where the next list is elsewhere entirely; each of those gaps is
tens of kilobytes, never an off by one.

That agreement is what makes the reading believable rather than merely consistent: the addresses
come from the pointer table and the counts come from the lists, so they are unrelated parts of the
file that turn out to describe the same layout. On the 525 the numbers also match what
harmony-decompiler reports independently, 487 lists with 482 of 486 packed.

#### Opcode `0x7F` takes an action list index

**Confirmed on arch 14**, from the operand ranges rather than from the firmware.

| | 700 | 600 |
|---|---|---|
| uses | 2795 | 1465 |
| distinct operands | 1576 | 834 |
| operand range | 52 to 7655 | 23 to 4755 |
| action lists in the config | 8037 | 4955 |
| the five runs end at index | 17, 4323, 5147, **7655**, 8036 | 11, 2721, 3154, **4755**, 4954 |

Every operand is a valid index into the table, and the largest is **exactly the last index before
the final run**, on both configs, at two different values. Operands never reach into that final run
at all: 381 lists on the 700 and 199 on the 600 are addressed by the table and never named by a
`0x7F`, so those are entry points something else reaches.

That is a boundary landing on a structure derived from a different part of the file, twice, which is
what makes it a reading rather than a range that happens to fit. It also matches what
harmony-decompiler reports for arch 9, where `0x7F` is "run an action list", so the meaning
transfers across architectures even though the wider inventory does not.

#### The final run belongs to base slot 8

The lists a `0x7F` never names are not orphans. Base slot 8 holds a `u16` reference to **every** list
in the final run and to no list outside it: 381 references covering 7656 to 8036 on the 700, and 199
covering 4756 to 4954 on the 600, which is a bijection. A section that size would hold about twenty
values in that band by chance.

Slot 8's own record layout is **not established**. The references are not evenly spaced, so it holds
variable length records rather than a table, and whether it also names lists in the other four runs
cannot be told by scanning, because that index range is wide enough for coincidences to swamp it.
`docs/findings.md` section 26.

#### `{0x7A a; 0x6C b}` is most of an arch 14 config

**Confirmed on architecture 14.** 2832 of the 700's 8037 lists and 1888 of the 600's 4955 are two
instruction lists of exactly this shape, which is also every `0x6C` in each file: the opcode occurs
nowhere else.

Partitioned by the `0x7A` operand they form six groups on the 700 and four on the 600, each of
exactly **472** lists, and every group carries the **same 472 values** of `0x6C` once each. Those
472 are identical on both remotes:

```
451 values  0 to 450, contiguous
 21 values  0x8000 to 0x8014, which is 0 to 20 with bit 15 set
```

A set that does not change between two owners' configs on two models is a **vocabulary the format
carries**, not user data. So most of base slot 10 is the complete cross product of a small per
config set with that vocabulary, one list per pair.

*A device selector and a function id would fit the counts, since the 700 supports six devices and
its config has six groups, and the `0x7A` operands look like database identifiers rather than
indices. Not established.*

Architecture 12 has an analogous pair, `{0x75 a; 0x7E b}`, with one group and a value set that is
neither the same size nor contiguous, so the structure does not transfer as it stands.
[findings.md](findings.md) section 28.

#### `0x7C` carries a value of at most 100

**Confirmed on architecture 14.** The operand splits at the byte: the high byte is a group, 0 to 5
on the 700 and 0 to 3 on the 600, and the low byte is 1 to 100.

Every use is in one of two shapes: lists made of nothing but `0x7C`, or as the third instruction of
`{0x7F, 0x7D, 0x7C}`. In a pure list of length `k`, every operand but the last has low byte 100 and
the whole list keeps one group, so it reads as `(k - 1) * 100 + n`:

| length | lists per group | remainders | value |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2, 3, 4 | 100 each | 1 to 100 | 101 to 400 |
| 5 | 50 | 1 to 50 | 401 to 450 |

The union is 101 to 450 per group, contiguous, each value once. **450 is also the top of the fixed
`0x6C` vocabulary**, which is 0 to 450, reached from a completely different direction. So the two
are the same enumeration: one instruction covers up to 100, more than one spells out the rest.

*What the enumeration counts is not established.* [findings.md](findings.md) section 29.

#### `0x07`, `0x0F`, `0x1F` and `0x3F` address a second operand space

**Confirmed on four architectures.** These four opcodes never carry an operand below `0xC000`, and
every other opcode in the inventory does. 10381 uses of the four, no exception, in ten configs
holding 85962 instructions between them.

| opcode | operands, signed, over the whole corpus | distinct | uses |
|---|---|---|---|
| `0x07` | `-14` to `-1` | 12 | 4587 |
| `0x0F` | `-192` to `-29` | 10 | 91 |
| `0x1F` | `-6400` to `-241` | 247 | 5329 |
| `0x3F` | `-16384` to `-2510` | 48 | 374 |

The lowest operand any of them takes is exactly `0xC000`, which is `-16384`. No value is ever
carried by two of the four. The band is not exclusive in the other direction: `0x7A` and `0x79`
also reach above `0xC000`.

`0x07` and `0x0F` draw from a **vocabulary fixed per architecture**: both configs of arch 14, of
arch 12 and of arch 8 give byte identical sets. `0x07` is `-14, -13, -11, -10, -9, -4, -3, -1` on
arch 14 and `-10, -9, -8, -7, -5, -4, -3, -1` on arch 12 and arch 8. `0x1F` and `0x3F` keep most of
their values across a pair and add config specific ones.

**Consequence for a codec, ahead of the meaning.** An operand at or above `0xC000` is a reference
into something the firmware supplies, not an index the generator assigned: it survives byte
identical between two remotes that share no equipment. Carry it through unchanged and never
renumber it.

*What the four name is not established.* [findings.md](findings.md) section 31.

#### `0x7D` sends an infrared code

**Confirmed on ten configs across four architectures.** The operand is `{ u8 group; u8 index }`
into the base slot 5 table above, and **the set of distinct operands is exactly the set of valid
`(group, index)` pairs**: every record is reached and nothing outside the table is named, 3058
records and 3058 distinct operands over the ten configs. Onto rather than one to one, since a
record can be sent from more than one list.

`0x7D` appears in exactly one list shape per config, `{0x7F, 0x7D, 0x7C}` on arch 14 and
`{0x7D, 0x7C}` on arch 8, 9 and 12, and in all 3164 of those lists the `0x7C` operand's high byte
equals the `0x7D` operand's. So the grouping is shared between the infrared database, `0x7C` and
`0x7D`. The accompanying `0x7C` value takes only `0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 10` across the corpus and is 1 in
2260 of the 3164 sends, which is a count and not an identifier.

Read with `gspm.ir_reference` and `gspm.ir_references`.
[findings.md](findings.md) section 33.

#### The interpreter, from the firmware

**Read out of two arch 14 images**, the Harmony 700 2.8 and the complete Harmony 600 0.2. This is
what the opcodes are executed by, so it constrains every reading of them.

An action list is spooled into a **circular queue of 120 bytes, exactly 40 three byte
instructions**, and drained by a separate loop. Same size on both images. The host can push into
the same queue over USB, which is what `MISC_QUEUE_ACTION` is for.

The dispatch is a **binary search on the opcode**, not a jump table and not an `XORLW` chain. Its
boundaries:

| range | handling |
|---|---|
| below `0x65` | a second dispatcher, not read yet. Five distinct opcodes, 12462 uses |
| `0x65` to `0x7F` | individual handlers, twenty distinct opcodes, 83359 uses |
| `0x80` and above | **one routine**, with bit 7 stripped from the opcode. 55 distinct, 2603 uses |

Placed by their handlers:

| opcode | meaning |
|---|---|
| `0x7A` | load the sixteen bit accumulator with the operand |
| `0x79` | add the operand to the accumulator |
| `0x78`, `0x77` | two more accumulator operations, through helper routines |
| `0x7B` | build an instruction from a runtime byte and push it back on the queue |
| `0x71` | **compare**: low byte indexes a lookup, low nibble of the high byte selects the operator, left hand side is a byte variable |
| `0x70` | the same comparison, with the accumulator as the left hand side |
| `0x72` | **map a state variable's value**: low byte a state variable, high byte a base slot 14 record |
| `0x1F` with operand `0xFFxx` | **select the current binding table entry**, low byte the index into base slot 9 |
| `0x1F` to `0x3E` with operand `0xF3xx` to `0xF6xx` | send a computed number to base slot 16 or 14, from the accumulator or from a byte register |

The comparison selector is `0` equal, `1` not equal, `2` greater, `3` less, `4` greater or equal,
`5` less or equal. Selectors `6` and `7` are not comparisons. **`0x71` uses exactly `0` to `5` and
nothing else**, over 2164 uses in ten configs, which is what made its high byte look like a group of
six. `0x70` uses `0` to `3` and also `7`, nine times.

The lookup all three of `0x70`, `0x71` and `0x72` index with their low byte is the **state variable
table**, base slot 13. [findings.md](findings.md) sections 34, 35 and 39.

#### The rest of the inventory, not established

Arch 14's most common opcodes include `0x6C`, which never appears in the arch 9 sample, so an opcode
table derived from the 525 does not cover the remotes on the bench.

| Opcode | 700 uses | distinct operands | operand range | reading |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `0x7C` | 7272 | 600 | 1 to 1380 | unknown |
| `0x7A` | 2875 | 10 | 0 to 65277 | unknown, and only ten distinct operands in 2875 uses |
| `0x6C` | 2832 | 472 | 0 to 32788 | unknown, arch 14 only |
| `0x7F` | 2795 | 1576 | 52 to 7655 | **action list index**, above |
| `0x1F` | 1215 | 121 | 59392 to 65290 | unknown; in the second operand space, above |
| `0x7E` | 861 | 268 | 0 to 373 | **enter the mode** at this index in base slot 6, above |
| `0x7D` | 372 | 350 | 0 to 1361 | **send an infrared code**, `{ u8 group; u8 index }`, below |
| `0x07` | 230 | 8 | 65522 to 65535 | unknown; in the second operand space, above |
| `0x71` | 708 | 73 | 9 to 33598 | unknown, but the operand splits: bit 15 a flag, high byte a group 0 to 5, low byte always under 64 |

**Corrected here:** the paragraph below was written when `0x7E` was measured and unplaced, and it is
kept because its measurements are still the record of what the operand statistics could and could
not see. `0x7E` **is** placed, in [findings.md](findings.md) section 37: it enters the base slot 6
mode its operand indexes. Read the paragraph as an account of why counting operands was not enough,
not as an open question. Its last sentence is the one that mattered: the maximum tracked nothing
countable in the config, because nobody had counted the mode table yet.

Its values are
dense over roughly 40 to the maximum with the bottom of the range mostly unused, and the maximum
tracks nothing countable in the config: 373 against 354 binding records and 350 infrared records on
the 700, 267 against 268 and 328 on the One. It is not an index into any of the six pointer arrays,
whose lengths are either far too small or far too large. It spreads across every list shape rather
than belonging to one, unlike `0x7D`. In `{0x7F, 0x7E}` each value goes with exactly one call target
in 138 of 139 cases on the 700, and sorting those pairs by target leaves the `0x7E` value non
decreasing about 90% of the time on all three architectures that use that shape, which says the two
are ordered by something shared rather than that one indexes the other.

One structural remark that holds whatever the meanings turn out to be. **Several opcodes carry bit
15 as a flag**: `0x6C` tops out at `0x8014` and `0x71` at `0x833E` on the 700 against `0x8336` on
the 600, which is the shape of an index with a marker rather than a range. Across the corpus that
middle region, `0x8000` to `0xBFFF`, holds only four opcodes and 1716 instructions, and it is
distinct from the `0xC000` band above it.

**Corrected here.** This paragraph used to say `0x07` and `0x1F` never carry a value below
`0xE800`. The floor is `0xC000`, it applies to four opcodes rather than two, and it is a boundary
rather than the smallest value observed. See the subsection above.

### One table, four architectures

The pointer table is the same table everywhere, with per architecture insertions rather than per
architecture meanings:

| Architecture | slots | insertions relative to the base layout |
|---|---|---|
| 9, 14 | 20 | none, this is the base layout |
| 8 | 21 | a NULL at slot 8 |
| 12 | 22 | a NULL at slot 8, and a real section at slot 18 |

So a base slot `b` sits at `b`, at `b + 1` for `b >= 8`, and arch 12 additionally pushes
`b >= 17` up by one more. `src/harmony/gspm.py` implements this as `base_slot` and `arch_slot`,
and refuses rather than guesses for an architecture whose insertions are not established.

Three independent fingerprints agree on this alignment across nine configs: the six pointer array
slots land on base slots 5, 7, 10, 11, 12 and 15; the single **one byte** section lands on base
slot 16; and base slot 18 is NULL. Any one of those alone would be arithmetic, and all three
agreeing is an alignment.

Why it is worth having: format work is done on arch 14, because there every config byte read
passes through one SPI primitive, while the remote most people own is the arch 12 Harmony One. A
section labelled on arch 14 transfers through this table instead of through a second
investigation. The one section arch 12 has and the base layout does not, its slot 18, is 2 bytes
in both One samples.

In the 1.6 MB Harmony One user config all 21 pointers land within the first 310 KiB. The
remaining 1.36 MB is reached indirectly, presumably the IR code database and the touchscreen
bitmaps.

## The key table: `LWJL`, `WLWL`

```
u8   event_code    event type in the top two bits, scan code in the rest
u16  ?             values are small and architecture dependent, meaning not established
u8   flags         meaning not established
```

An **event code is not a matrix address.** The top two bits are the event type and the rest is
the keypad scanner's own scan code:

| Bits 7,6 | Event |
|---|---|
| `00` | none, the handful of codes that are not keypad events at all |
| `01` | release |
| `10` | press |
| `11` | repeat |

Corrected: this document previously stated `0x80 | (row << 3) | col` with bit 7 marking a matrix
key, which made the arch 14 table describe a keypad that cannot exist. See
[findings.md](findings.md) section 17 for the three agreements that settle it.

| Sample | count | Shape |
|---|---|---|
| 700 user config, arch 14 | 163 | scan codes 1 to 54 in each of release, press and repeat, plus `0x06` with no event bits. `flags` is `0x00` or `0xA8`. |
| 600 user config, arch 14 | 162 | exactly 54 scan codes times 3 event types, nothing else. `flags` is `0x00` or `0x07`. |
| One user config, arch 12 | 55 | 52 press codes plus `0x06`, `0x07`, `0x2D` with no event bits. No release or repeat entries at all. `flags` is `0x7F` throughout. |
| 88x class config, arch 8 | 56 | 53 press codes plus the same three. Identical in all four arch 8 samples. |
| One safe-mode config | 2 | press of scan 47 and scan 46. A two button recovery UI. |
| 700 `Region_3` | 0 | empty |
| 525 config, arch 9 | n/a | the byte where a count would sit after `CMAH` is zero, so no table is claimed there |

So arch 14 enumerates all three event types for every key while arch 12 and arch 8 record presses
only. That is a real difference between the architectures rather than an artefact of the reading.

### Arch 8 and arch 12 share a canonical code ordering

47 `(event, scan)` pairs appear in both the One's table and the arch 8 table, and on that shared
subset the two list them in the **same order**, with exactly one adjacent transposition: the One
has scan 6 with no event bits, then press of scan 14, then scan 7 with no event bits, where arch 8
has the two no-event codes together. Drop press of scan 14 and the sequences are identical. Pinned
in `tests/test_gspm.py`, and unaffected by the corrected reading, which is worth noting because
the finding was originally derived under the wrong one.

Codes unique to each, which is presumably the physical difference between the two remotes:

| Only on the One | Only on arch 8 |
|---|---|
| `0x84` `0x89` `0x93` `0x9C` `0x9E` `0xA7` `0xAF` `0xB1` | `0xA9` `0xB6` `0xB8` `0xB9` `0xBA` `0xBB` `0xBD` `0xBE` `0xBF` |

Consequence, and it is the reason this matters: the ordering looks like Logitech's canonical
key order rather than anything per model. Establishing which physical button each code belongs
to on one remote should therefore carry most of the way to the others. Upstream reports the
same relationship between arch 8 and arch 9, 41 codes of 51 shared in order, which is
independent support for the same conclusion.

### The arch 14 table does describe that remote's keypad, after all

**Resolved.** This document used to say the 600's table could not be its physical key matrix,
because 108 codes cannot describe 56 positions. Both halves of that were artefacts of the wrong
bit split. Under the corrected reading the 600's table is 54 scan codes times 3 event types, and
54 scan codes describe 54 physical keys on a keypad the firmware scans as a 1 to 56 linear index.
The count works out exactly, with nothing left over.

So no translation layer between the scanner's index and the config's codes needs to exist, which
was the open question here. The scanner's index **is** the config's scan code.

### The key table is not the button to action map

Whatever binds a key to an action, it is not this table. Two configs of the same Harmony 700 whose
owner recorded reassigning three buttons between them carry a byte identical key table, all 163
records. See [findings.md](findings.md) section 16.

That leaves the table looking like a description of the remote's own keypad and event capability,
which is consistent with it being identical across the four arch 8 samples and across both One
samples. The remaining `u16` and `flags` fields are still unexplained.

## Infrared parameter block

The only leaf structure decoded so far. Reached via the pointer that the firmware's action
dispatcher routes to the IR subsystem.

```
0x00  u16  carrier period
0x02  u8   carrier on-time (duty)
```

Both are converted to instruction cycles with `value * 4 / 10`, then a fixed loop overhead is
subtracted, 19 cycles for the period and 8 for the on-time, clamped at zero. Off-time is then
computed as `period - on`.

The `* 4 / 10` implies 4 instruction cycles per 0.1 microsecond, so a 4 MIPS core at 16 MHz.
Cross-checked against a real carrier: 38 kHz is a 26.3 us period, so the stored value is 263,
and `263 * 4 / 10` = 105 cycles, which at 4 MIPS is 26.25 us. That closes, and it confirms both
the 0.1 us storage unit and the clock.

## Open questions

1. What are the 19, 20 or 21 section slots? Twelve are named now, so the question is the
   remaining eight or so. Method in [roadmap.md](roadmap.md) step 6.
2. Three of the four IR encoding classes. The dispatcher routes four selectors and only one is
   traced. **Corrected here:** this entry used to say arch 8's second population with headers near
   303 / 310 was one of the other classes. It is not. Every record's first byte is its class, and
   all 2858 records on arch 8, 12 and 14 are class 1, so the records the framer cannot read are
   class 1 too. The other three classes are used by no config in the corpus at all, which makes
   them a firmware-only problem rather than a decoding one. `docs/findings.md` section 42.
3. The key table's semantic difference between architectures, and the meaning of `flags`
   (`0x00`, `0x07`, `0x73`, `0x7F` observed) and of `index` (sequential on the One, all zero on
   the 600, small values plus an outlier on arch 8).
4. The 288-byte table at arch 12 flash `0x000000-0x00011F`, in which every nibble is one of
   {6, 7, E, F}. On NOR flash that is the signature of a counter advanced by clearing one bit
   at a time. Boot counter, config generation counter and wear map are all plausible. Diffing
   that range across two dumps of the same remote taken at different times would settle it.
